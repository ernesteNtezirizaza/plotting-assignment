# Fuel Economy Data Analysis

This project analyzes a vehicle fuel economy dataset using Python, Matplotlib, and Seaborn. The analysis includes data exploration, visualization (histograms and heatmaps), and interpretation of relationships between variables relevant to fuel efficiency and greenhouse gas emissions.

## Project Structure

```
fuel_econ.csv
Plotting_Assignment.ipynb
outputs/
    co2_histogram.png
    correlation_heatmap.png
    displ_histogram.png
    fescore_histogram.png
```

- **fuel_econ.csv**: The dataset containing vehicle fuel economy and emissions data.
- **Plotting_Assignment.ipynb**: Jupyter notebook with all code, analysis, and visualizations.
- **outputs/**: Folder containing generated plots.

## Features

- Loads and explores the fuel economy dataset.
- Creates histograms for CO2 emissions, engine displacement, and fuel efficiency score.
- Generates a correlation heatmap for numerical features.
- Interprets the relationships between variables.
- Discusses feature selection for predicting greenhouse gas score.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- pandas
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- numpy
- Jupyter Notebook

Install dependencies with:

```sh
pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn numpy
```

## Usage

1. Clone this repository or download the files.
2. Open `Plotting_Assignment.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab.
3. Run the notebook cells to reproduce the analysis and plots.

## Outputs

Plots are saved in the `outputs/` directory:
- `co2_histogram.png`
- `displ_histogram.png`
- `fescore_histogram.png`
- `correlation_heatmap.png`

## Interpretation

The notebook includes markdown cells interpreting the visualizations and discussing which features are most relevant for predicting greenhouse gas scores.
